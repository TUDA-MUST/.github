## More about us

At MUST, we pursue cutting-edge research across **Robotics and Human-Machine Interaction**, **Electromechanical Sensors and Actuators**, and **Ultrasonic Technology and Medical Engineering**. For instance, our sensor-integrated insoles—3D-printed devices equipped with ferroelectret sensors—enable real-time gait detection for wearable robotics and exoskeleton control. In the field of electromechanical transducers, we develop innovative force measurement and sensor integration techniques to enhance performance and reliability. Moreover, our work on in vivo pulse measurement employs flexible, biocompatible ferroelectret sensors with high sensitivity and electromagnetic shielding for precise heart rate monitoring. Additionally, we explore acoustic levitation for life sciences, leveraging ultrasonic waves to enable the contactless manipulation and analysis of sensitive biological samples.

These examples are just a glimpse of our broad research portfolio—with many more topics and innovations in progress.
